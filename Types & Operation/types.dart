//Youâ€™re a teacher, and in your class, attendance is worth 20% of the grade, the homework is
//worth 30% and the exam is worth 50%. Your student got 90 points for her attendance, 80
//points for her homework and 94 points on her exam. Calculate her grade as an integer
//percentage rounded down.

void main() {
  int attendance = 90;
  int homework = 80;
  int exam = 94;

  double total = (attendance * 0.2) + (homework * 0.3) + (exam * 0.5);
  int grade = total.floor();

  print(grade); // Output: 89
