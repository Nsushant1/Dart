# Dart Practice Repository 🐦

Welcome to my Dart repository! This project contains my practice programs, exercises, and mini-projects written in the Dart programming language.

## 📁 Structure

The repository is organized into different Dart files, each focusing on a specific concept or exercise, such as:

- Variables and Constants
- Arithmetic Operations
- Conditional Statements
- Functions
- Loops
- OOP (coming soon)
- Flutter (coming soon)

## 🧠 What I'm Learning

- Dart syntax and fundamentals
- Working with types (`int`, `double`, `String`, `bool`)
- Using `const` and `final`
- Writing functions and solving math problems
- Getting ready for Flutter app development

## 🚀 How to Run

Make sure Dart is installed on your system.  
You can run any Dart file using:

dart filename.dart
